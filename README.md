# LEGO Mindstorms 51515 GamePad

## About

The 51515 GamePad is a project which tries to bring some game ideas to the
51515 (and potentially Spike Prime) hub.

## Building the GamePad

I uploaded really simple building instructions of the GamePad. These were made
using Studio 2 from BrickLink. They are currently not ideal because of a
rendering bug in the software but I am sure everyone can assemble it.

Click [here](LEGO%20Mindstorms5%20Gamepad-Instructions.pdf) for the instructions.
The final GamePad looks like this:

## List of Games

I hope this list will grow over time. All my game ideas are listed here

### Emotions
Emotions is a game similar to simon says which pretends to predict a person's
emotion by randomly picking it from a list of pre-encoded emojis on the 51515
hub.

To play hold down the left key on the GamePad. Once released the final pick is
made.
